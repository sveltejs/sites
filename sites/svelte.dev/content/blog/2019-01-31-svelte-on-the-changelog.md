Earlier this month, I had the privilege of appearing on [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast), a podcast about software development. We had a fun (for me) and wide-ranging conversation:

* life as a coder inside a newsroom
* the big compilers-as-frameworks trend
* scalability
* the [Great Divide](https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/)

...and, most importantly, Svelte 3.

Unless you hang out in our [Discord server](https://svelte.dev/chat) or follow [@sveltejs](https://twitter.com/sveltejs) on Twitter, you might not know that Svelte 3 is just around the corner, and it's going to be a huge release. We've rethought the developer experience from the ground up, and while it *will* be a nuisance if you need to upgrade a Svelte 2 app (more on that soon) we think you're going to love it.

On the podcast [Adam](https://twitter.com/adamstac), [Jerod](https://twitter.com/jerodsanto) and I talk about some of the changes and why we're making them. You can listen here or on the [podcast page](https://changelog.com/podcast/332).
