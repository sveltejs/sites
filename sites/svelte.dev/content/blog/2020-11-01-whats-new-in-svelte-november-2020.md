Welcome back to the "What's new in Svelte" series! This month, we're covering new features & bug fixes, last month's Svelte Summit and some stand-out sites and libraries...

## New features & impactful bug fixes

1. Destructuring Promises now works as expected by using the `{#await}` syntax
 (**3.29.3**, [Example](https://svelte.dev/repl/3fd4e2cecfa14d629961478f1dac2445?version=3.29.3))
2. Slot forwarding (released in 3.29.0) should no longer hang during compilation (**3.29.3**, [Example](https://svelte.dev/repl/29959e70103f4868a6525c0734934936?version=3.29.3))
3. Better typings for the `get` function in `svelte/store` and on lifecycle hooks (**3.29.1**)

**What's going on in Sapper?**

Sapper got some new types in its `preload` function, which will make typing easier if you are using TypeScript. See the [Sapper docs](https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Typing_the_function) on how to use them. There also were fixes to `preload` links in exported sites. Route layouts got a few fixes too - including ensuring CSS is applied to nested route layouts. You can also better organize your files now that extensions with multiple dots are supported. (**0.28.10**)


For all the features and bugfixes see the CHANGELOGs for [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).


## [Svelte Summit](https://sveltesummit.com/) was Svelte-tacular!
- Rich Harris demoed the possible future of Svelte development in a talk titled "Futuristic Web Development". The not-yet-public project is called SvelteKit (name may change) and will bring a first-class developer experience and more flexibility for build outputs. If you want to get the full sneak-peek, [check out the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfdtmcZ4d0).
- 17 speakers made the best of the conference's virtual format... From floating heads to seamless demos, Svelte developers from every skill level will find something of interest in this year's [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8bMgX1kyZThM1sbYCoWdTcpiYysJsSeu)
