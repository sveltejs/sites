It's the last "What's new in Svelte" of the year and there's lots to celebrate! This month's coverage includes updates from `rollup-plugin-svelte`, `Sapper` and `SvelteKit` and a bunch of showcases from the Svelte community!

## New features & impactful bug fixes

1. `$$props`, `$$restProps`, and `$$slots` are all now supported in custom web components (**3.29.5**, [Example](https://svelte.dev/repl/ad8e6f39cd20403dacd1be84d71e498d?version=3.29.5)) and  `slot` components now support spread props: `<slot {...foo} />` (**3.30.0**)
2. A new `hasContext` lifecycle function makes it easy to check whether a `key` has been set in the context of a parent component (**3.30.0** & **3.30.1**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs#run-time-svelte-hascontext))
3. There is now a new `SvelteComponentTyped` class which makes it easier to add strongly typed components that extend base Svelte components. Component library and framework authors rejoice! An example: `export class YourComponent extends SvelteComponentTyped<{aProp: boolean}, {click: MouseEvent}, {default: {aSlot: string}}> {}` (**3.31.0**, [RFC](https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/pull/37))
4. Transitions within `{:else}` blocks should now complete successfully (**3.29.5**, [Example](https://svelte.dev/repl/49cef205e5da459594ef2eafcbd41593?version=3.29.5))
5. Svelte now includes an export map, which explicitly states which files can be imported from its npm package (**3.29.5** with some fixes in **3.29.6**, **3.29.7** and **3.30.0**)
6. `rollup-plugin-svelte` had a new [7.0.0 release](https://github.com/sveltejs/rollup-plugin-svelte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). The biggest change is that the `css` option was removed. Users who were using that option should add another plugin like `rollup-plugin-css-only` as demonstrated [in the template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template/blob/5b1135c286f7a649daa99825a077586655051649/rollup.config.js#L48)


## What's going on in Sapper?
Lots of new TypeScript definition improvements to make editing Sapper apps even easier! CSS for dynamic imports also should now work in `client.js` files. (Unreleased)

## What's the deal with SvelteKit?
We're glad you asked! If you didn't catch Rich's blog post from early last month, [you can find it here](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit)!

For all the features and bugfixes see the CHANGELOGs for [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
