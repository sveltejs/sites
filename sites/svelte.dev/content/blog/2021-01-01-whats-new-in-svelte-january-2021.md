Happy new year from Svelte! In the last month we made progress on Sapper's upcoming release, fine-tuned our `SvelteComponent` typings, and have seen some amazing apps, sites, and libraries coming out in the showcase.

## What's changed in Svelte?

A new minor release replaces the `SvelteComponent` class with a `SvelteComponentTyped` class. This renaming should help with backwards compatibility. We've updated [last month's blog post](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-new-in-svelte-december-2020) to avoid any confusion with the name change.

If you're using `SvelteComponent` or the new `SvelteComponentTyped` in your project or library, let us know what you're using it for and we'll add it to the showcase!


## What's going on in Sapper?

More quality of life features are landing in the upcoming release every day. `0.29.0` will include new TypeScript definitions, fixes to scroll tracking and prefetching behavior, and improvements to the runtime router to support encoded query parameters.

If you're upgrading from 0.28.x, check out [the migration guide](https://sapper.svelte.dev/migrating/#0_28_to_0_29) for steps on updating to Sapper 0.29.


## Is SvelteKit ready yet?

To avoid too much churn during development, SvelteKit is still being worked on in a private repo. There will be an announcement on the Discord, blog and Twitter when it's ready for a larger group of users and contributors.

In the meantime, you can explore the current build by running `npm init svelte@next` from your command line.

As cautioned in _[What's the deal with SvelteKit?](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit)_, there are no docs or support available yet... So use at your own risk / for your own enjoyment!
