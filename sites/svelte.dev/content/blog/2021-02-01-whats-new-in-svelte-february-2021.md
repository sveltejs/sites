With the shortest month of the year coming up, Svelte maintainers and community members alike have been busy this last month – from big changes in `svelte-loader`, `prettier-plugin-svelte`, `rollup-plugin-svelte`, and `language-tools` to steady progress in Sapper and `svelte-preprocess`. Meanwhile, lots of folks have been busy integrating Svelte with other popular frameworks.

## New compiler features
- Aria roles from the [WAI-ARIA Graphics Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/graphics-aria-1.0/#role_definitions) are now recognized as valid aria roles in Svelte components (**3.31.1**)
- Compiler warnings for the common React attributes, `className` and `htmlFor`, now make it easier to port React components to Svelte (**3.31.1**)

Have a suggestion for a compiler feature or want to help implement new features/bug fixes? Check out the ["triage: good first issue" tag for Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22triage%3A+good+first+issue%22)


## New bits in language-tools

- User disabled auto import suggestions no longer show in VS Code (**103.0.0**)
- Renaming a variable is now safer with smart additions of a prefix/suffix to renamed variables (**104.0.0**)
- Semantic (token) highlighting for TypeScript users lets theme makers apply semantic styling in their themes, if they support it (**104.0.0**)
- "Extract Component" has been added to the context menu - allowing you to extract components out of files without having to open the command window to type "Svelte: Extract Component" (**104.0.0**)
- The VS Code extension now listens to JavaScript/TypeScript file changes - you no longer need to save the files for the changes to be noticed (**104.1.0**)

For the complete list of changes, check out the language-tools [Releases page](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/releases).

A great way to try the language tools is to download the [Svelte Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). This extension provides syntax highlighting and rich intellisense for Svelte components in VS Code, using the svelte language server. Check your editor's extension sources to see if there's a Svelte plugin for your IDE or build your own (see [coc-svelte](https://github.com/coc-extensions/coc-svelte) for example)!

## Big improvements across the Svelte ecosystem

- [svelte-loader](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader) released a major version, 3.0.0 - featuring Webpack 5 and Node 14 support, better hot reloading, and new `compilerOptions` to match `rollup-plugin-svelte`. Breaking changes include dropping Svelte 2 and Node 8 support. [More info in the changelog](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- [rollup-plugin-svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/rollup-plugin-svelte) is now at version 7.x - with support for relative filenames, better handling of sourcemaps, and consistent `compilerOptions`. Be sure to [checkout the changelog](https://github.com/sveltejs/rollup-plugin-svelte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for breaking changes when upgrading
- [svelte-preprocess](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess) iterated through some 4.6.x releases this month to improve postcss and scss handling and fix sourcemap transformation for typescript users. [More info in the changelog](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
- [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) got some improvements in scroll tracking and handling encoding query parameters. Dynamic imports also now work as expected in browsers that don't support ES modules. These changes from 0.29.0 and a step-by-step migration guide can be found [in the changelog](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- [prettier-plugin-svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/prettier-plugin-svelte) version 2 was released. It received an overhaul and comes with a rewrite of the HTML formatting. The output is now much more in line with how standard Prettier formats HTML. Better defaults for `svelteBracketNewLine` and `options-scripts-markup-styles` should now match how the majority of users like to order the code blocks. Additionally, Prettier's `htmlWhitespaceSensitivity` setting is now supported. [More info in the changelog](https://github.com/sveltejs/prettier-plugin-svelte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

New changes to the Svelte Society website include [a new cheat sheet](https://sveltesociety.dev/cheatsheet) for easy access to useful code patterns and some smaller visual fixes across the site. **Want to help make the Svelte Society website ready for prime time**?
