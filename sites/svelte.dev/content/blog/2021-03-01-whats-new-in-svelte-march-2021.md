Lots to cover this month with releases from across the Svelte ecosystem. Most importantly, Svelte Summit Spring 2021 has an [Open Call for Speakers](https://sessionize.com/svelte-summit-spring-2021). **The deadline is March 14** so if you have an idea for a talk, submit it now!

Let's dive into the news üê¨

## What's new in `sveltejs/svelte`
* SSR store handling has been reworked to subscribe and unsubscribe as in DOM mode. SSR stores should work much more consistently now (**3.31.2**, see [custom stores](https://svelte.dev/examples/custom-stores) and [Server-side component API ](https://svelte.dev/docs#run-time-server-side-component-api))
* Multiple instances of the same action are now allowed on an element (**3.32.0**, [example](https://svelte.dev/repl/01a14375951749dab9579cb6860eccde?version=3.32.0))
* The new `foreign` namespace should make it easier for alternative compile targets (like Svelte Native and SvelteGUI) by disabling certain HTML5-specific behaviour and checks (**3.32.0**, [more info](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/5652))
* Support for inline comment sourcemaps in code from preprocessors (**3.32.0**)
* Destructured defaults are now allowed to refer to other variables (**3.33.0**, [example](https://svelte.dev/repl/0ee7227e1b45465b9b47d7a5ae2d1252?version=3.33.0))
* Custom elements will now call `onMount` functions when connecting and clean up when disconnecting (**3.33.0**, checkout [this PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/4522) for an interesting conversation on how folks are using Svelte with Web Components)
* A `cssHash` option has been added to the compiler options to control the classname used for CSS scoping (**3.34.0**, [docs](https://svelte.dev/docs#compile-time-svelte-compile))
* Continued improvement to TypeScript definitions

## New from `sveltejs/language-tools`

- For language server clients that don't support `didChangeWatchedFiles`, a fallback file watcher will be used instead
- New highlighting rules for store accessors and element directives (like `bind:` and `class:`)
- HTML tags can now be renamed together
- Mustache tags parsing is now more robust and will provide better intellisense in more situations
