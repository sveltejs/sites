Two projects that have been months (even years) in the making have made their way out into the world. SvelteKit is now in public beta and slotted components are now available in Svelte!

## What's up with SvelteKit?
[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) - Svelte's versatile framework for building SSR, serverless applications, or SPAs - is now officially in public beta. Expect bugs! Lots more detail in the [latest blog post](https://svelte.dev/blog/sveltekit-beta). Want to know when 1.0 is close? Check out the milestone on [github](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/milestone/2).

Want to learn more about how to get started, what's different compared to Sapper, new features and migration paths? Check out this week's [episode of Svelte Radio](https://www.svelteradio.com/episodes/svelte-kit-public-beta) for a deep dive with Antony, Kev and Swyx.

## New in Svelte & Language Tools
- Slotted components, including `<svelte:fragment slot="...">` lets component consumers target specific slots with rich content (**Svelte 3.35.0, Language Tools [104.5.0](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/releases/tag/extensions-104.5.0)**, check out the [docs](https://svelte.dev/docs#template-syntax-svelte-fragment) and the [tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte-fragment))
- Linked editing now works for HTML in Svelte files (**Language Tools, [104.6.0](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/releases/tag/extensions-104.6.0)**)
- Type definitions `svelte.d.ts` are now resolved in order, allowing library authors to ship type definitions with their svelte components (**Language Tools, [104.7.0](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/releases/tag/extensions-104.7.0)**)
- [vite-plugin-svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte) is available for general use of Svelte in Vite. `npm init @vitejs/app` includes Svelte options using this plugin.
