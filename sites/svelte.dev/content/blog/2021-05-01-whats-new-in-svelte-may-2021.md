Last week, Svelte Summit blew us away with a mountain of content! [Check out the full recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnr9XWvjJHw) or an audio-only (p)review [on Svelte Radio](https://www.svelteradio.com/episodes/svelte-summit-party-episode). Now let's get into this month's news...

## New features in the Svelte Compiler
- `:global()` is now supported as part of compound CSS selectors (**3.38.0**, [Example](https://svelte.dev/repl/54148fd2af484f2c84977c94e523c7c5?version=3.38.0))
- CSS custom properties can now be passed to components for use cases such as theming (**3.38.0**, [Docs coming soon](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/6268))

## New in SvelteKit
- [kit.svelte.dev](https://kit.svelte.dev/) has a fresh new look and the [SvelteKit Demo Site](https://netlify.demo.svelte.dev/) got a fresh set of paint. Check it out by running `npm init svelte@next`
- You can now use `@sveltejs/adapter-static` to create a single-page app or SPA by specifying a fallback page ([PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1181), [Docs](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-static))
- Disable Server-side Rendering (SSR) app-wide or on a page-by-page basis ([PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/713))
- Error messages thrown during pre-rendering are now much more informative and readable ([PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1062), [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/layouts#error-pages))
- Layouts can now be reset to prevent pages from inheriting the root layout. This is useful if you have a specific layout for a page or i18n variation ([PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1061), [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/layouts#resets))
- `fetch` in SvelteKit code will now use the environment-provided implementation, whenever possible. If `fetch` is unavailable, it will be polyfilled by adapters ([PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1066), [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/loading#input-fetch))

## New in Svelte & Language Tools
- `svelte-preprocess` now supports the "extends" field of the tsconfig.json (4.7.2)
- HTML `style` attributes now have hover & auto-complete. Foreign namespaces and ESM configs are now supported in the Svelte language server & extensions
- The Svelte language tools can now infer slot/event types from their props if a generic relationship between them was defined
