As the northern hemisphere heats up, Svelte has stayed cool with lots of performance and bug fixes, better TypeScript support, and lots of new components & tools from around the ecosystem. Let's take a peek ðŸ‘€

## New in SvelteKit
- `adapter-node` now precompresses assets using gzip & brotli ([#1693](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1693))
- Support for TypeScript transpilation has been added to the `svelte-kit package` tooling ([#1633](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1633))
- Improved caching defaults in `adapter-node` ([#1416](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1416))
- Allow configuring Rollup output options ([#1572](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1572))
- Fixed usage of SSL with HMR ([#1517](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1517))



## Features & bug fixes from around svelte/*
- [Svelte 3.38.3](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3383) (released June 22) includes a bunch of performance and bug fixes - including hydration optimizations, `this` preservation in bubbled events, and more!
- The latest language tools releases added support for prop renaming from outside of a component, PostCSS syntax grammar, and a `.d.ts` output target in `svelte2tsx` which can be used to create type definitions from Svelte files.
- Also in language tools, some long-awaited experimental features for enhanced TypeScript support were added - including explicitly typing all possible component events or slots, and using generics. Have a look at [the RFC](https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/pull/38) for more details and leave feedback in [this issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/issues/442) if you are using it.
- `svelte-scroller` got some quality-of-life fixes in 2.0.7 - fixing an initial width bug and updating its `index` more conservatively


## Coming soon to Svelte
- Constants in markup ([RFC](https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0000-markup-constants.md)): Adds a new `{@const ...}` tag that defines a local constant ([PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/6413))
