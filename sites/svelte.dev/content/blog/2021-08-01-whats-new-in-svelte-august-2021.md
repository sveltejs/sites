From The Changelog ([JS Party Ep. 182](https://changelog.com/jsparty/182)) to Svelte Radio (Episodes [29](https://share.transistor.fm/s/adc23e84) and [30](https://share.transistor.fm/s/6316622d)), it seems that folks couldn't help but talk about Svelte, this month! Also, shadow DOM support and new export and await functionality are new in Svelte.

## New in Svelte

July was the most active month for the Svelte core repo since late 2019 as we really worked to reduce the number of outstanding PRs and saw the release of Svelte 3.39.0, 3.40.0, and 3.41.0. Tons of bug fixes were added as well as the following new features:

- The `|trusted` event modifier allows you to check if an event is trusted before it's called ([#6137](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/6137))
- The new `svelte/ssr` package to support work on improving SvelteKit SSR ([#6416](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/6416))
- A new `errorMode` compiler option to support improved preprocessing of TypeScript files ([#6194](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/6194))
- You can now specify a `ShadowRoot` as the `target` when creating a component - making it possible to render Svelte components inside the shadow DOM ([#5869](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/5869))
- The `export { ... } from` ([#2214](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/2214)), `export let { ... } =` ([#5612](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/5612)) and `{#await ... then/catch}` ([#6270](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/6270)) syntaxes are all now supported in Svelte components

For a full list of features and bug fixes, check out the [Svelte changelog](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## SvelteKit Updates
- `prerender.force` is now `prerender.onError` which lets you fine-tune which errors fail the build and which do not ([#2007](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/2007))
- esbuild's configuration is now exposed for use with SvelteKit adapters ([#1914](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1914))
- Error messages are friendlier now for common config errors ([#1910](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1910)) and compiler errors ([#1827](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1827))
- Cookies will only be passed through if the target host is the same as the SvelteKit application or a more specific subdomain of it ([#1847](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1847))
- index.js exports will now be changed to directory exports when packaging - making for nicer imports ([#1905](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1905))
- Vite.js's `mode` is now exposed from `$app/env` ([#1789](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1789))
- Better types across the board ([#1778](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1778), [#1791](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1791), [#1646](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1646))

## Features & bug fixes from around svelte/*
- Language Tools now better support the "Workplace Trust" functionality (used in VS Code)
- In svelte2tsx, ambient type declarations are now renamed to avoid conflicting declarations in the future. Users are now expected to provide the ambient type definitions themselves - fixing JS output
- Sapper released v0.29.2 which fixes regex routes, status codes when requesting a directory, and exports when a user has not provided a `base` tag ([changelog](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))
