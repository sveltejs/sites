This month, Svelte was [voted StackOverflow's most loved web framework](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks), Tan Li Hau [talked to Svelte Radio](https://share.transistor.fm/s/84c7521b) about his [Svelte-filled YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbmC3HP3FaAFdcZkui8YoMQ), and SvelteKit made even more progress towards its 1.0 release!

## New in Svelte

- `use:actions` can now be used on `<svelte:body>` (**3.42.0**)
- `HTMLElement`, `SVGElement` (**3.42.2**) and `BigInt` (**3.42.3**) are now known globals
- There is less code in Svelte's output thanks to the following improvements in **3.42.2**:
  - Whitespace is now collapsed in class and style attributes
  - Hydrated components have been updated to only rely upon helpers for creating the types of elements present in the component
- Scaling is now accounted for in `flip` animations (**3.42.2**)
- All `<option>`s in a `<select>` are now deselected when the bound value doesn't match any of them (**3.42.2**)

## SvelteKit Updates

Svelte maintainers are [looking for help getting SvelteKit to 1.0](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/2100). We've knocked out over 100 issues that were on the 1.0 milestone. There's only a couple dozen left and we'd love a hand making that list a bit shorter!

If you'd like to help, please consider working on any of the [1.0 milestone issues](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.0).

The focus this past month was on continuing to iron out any kinks, with well over 100 PRs merged. A few new features went in as well...

- SvelteKit will now detect if a prerendered app is trying to access a query parameter and return an error instead of failing silently ([#2104](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/2104))
- `adapter-node` now lets you [add the Kit middleware to your own server](https://kit.svelte.dev/faq#integrations) for use with other middleware. You can also [add middleware in dev mode](https://kit.svelte.dev/faq#how-do-i-use-x-with-sveltekit-how-do-i-use-middleware) with more improvements to come in this area
- The new [`sequence` helper lets you chain together multiple `handle` calls](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#sveltejs-kit-hooks)
- A new [`handleError` hook](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/hooks#handleerror) gives you the option to send data to an error tracking service, or to customise the formatting before printing the error to the console.
- `adapter-node` can now listen on socket path ([#2048](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/2048))
