With SvelteKit crossing the [80% complete mark](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/milestone/2), over [5000 stars](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit) on GitHub, and now having more usage than Sapper, there's never been a better time to try it out! Many in the community have, making for quite a large showcase this month...

Also, don't miss out on [Svelte Summit](https://sveltesummit.com/) on November 20th - featuring speakers from around the world. Keep an eye out for a watch party in your area ðŸ‘€

Now onto what's new!

## New in Svelte and SvelteKit
- [svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev/) now runs on SvelteKit alongside [sveltesociety.dev](https://sveltesociety.dev). svelte.dev is a relatively complicated site with live code editing, authentication, and a markdown-based blog - making it a great way for us to really test out SvelteKit
- A new compiler option, `enableSourcemap`, provides more control over the compiler output for JS and CSS sourcemaps (**3.44.0**). With this new feature, SvelteKit and the Vite Svelte plugin can now properly handle environment variables in `.svelte` templates (See [sveltejs/kit#720](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/720) and [sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte#201](https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte/pull/201))
- The Svelte Language Tools now support reading the configuration of the VS Code CSS settings ([#1219](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/issues/1219))
- `vite-plugin-svelte` added a new `experimental.prebundleSvelteLibraries` option that makes it much faster to load Svelte libraries with many components like icon libraries and UI frameworks. The option can be set in the root of `svelte.config.js`. Please test it out and give us feedback!
- SvelteKit will only route endpoints on the client, unless marked as `rel="external"` - reducing the size of the client JS and making it easier to refactor the router in the future ([2656](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/2656))
- SvelteKit no longer supports Node 12 ([2604](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/2604))
- SvelteKit was upgraded from Vite 2.6.0 to Vite 2.6.12 fixing an issue where Vite would corrupt the Svelte runtime (https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/4306). It also included two fixes from the SvelteKit team to avoid or make diagnosing Vite issues in SvelteKit templates easier (https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/5192 and https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/5193). Vite 2.7 is currently available in beta with additional fixes for SSR
