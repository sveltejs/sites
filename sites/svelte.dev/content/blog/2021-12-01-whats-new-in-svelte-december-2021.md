With SvelteKit getting more and more stable each day, there's not much to cover in terms of code changes other than bug fixes... So, in this month's newsletter, we'll be covering Svelte Summit Fall 2021!

If you want to dive deep into the last month's worth of bug fixes, check out the [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md) changelogs, respectively.


## What happened at Svelte Summit?

If you missed Svelte Summit, you can watch the entire live stream on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Df-9EKvZr0) and catch a recap in the [#svelte-summit channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/YmHcdnhu).

Here are the highlights:
- [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/rich_harris) took us through a tour of Svelte's history and announced [his move to Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-welcomes-rich-harris-creator-of-svelte) - where he will be helping maintain Svelte full-time! ([20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Df-9EKvZr0&t=1200s))
- [Steph Dietz](https://twitter.com/steph_dietz_) explained how Svelte's simple abstractions makes it easy for beginners and experts alike to learn and use JavaScript - without the boilerplate ([29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Df-9EKvZr0&t=1740s))
- [Kevin Bridges](https://twitter.com/kevinast) dove deep into Svelte's reactivity logic by visualizing it through `ReflectiveCounter` and showing how to "fine tune" it, as needed.

- [Mateo Morris](https://twitter.com/_mateomorris) launched [Primo](https://primo.af/), an all-in-one SvelteKit CMS to help build and manage static sites ([1:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Df-9EKvZr0&t=4354s))
- [Guillermo Rauch](https://vercel.com/about/rauchg) explained Vercel's commitment to Svelte, what it means to have Rich on the team, and what's coming next from the company... ([1:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Df-9EKvZr0&t=4914s))
- [Geoff Rich](https://twitter.com/geoffrich_) introduced various ways to modify motion and transitions within Svelte to be more accessible to all users of the web. Slides and a full transcription of the talk are available on [Geoff's site](https://geoffrich.net/posts/svelte-summit-2021/). ([1:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Df-9EKvZr0&t=5550s))
- [Dean Fogarty](https://df.id.au/) demoed a number of different use-cases for custom stores - transforming data to and from storage mechanisms within Svelte. Transcript and code is available on [Dean's GitHub](https://github.com/angrytongan/svelte-summit-2021). ([1:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Df-9EKvZr0&t=6186s))

- [Austin Crim](https://twitter.com/crim_codes) connected learning to code on the web to learning how to play an instrument.

Thanks to [Kevin](https://twitter.com/kevmodrome) and all the Svelte Society volunteers for pulling together such an amazing event! Excitingly, [Kevin announced](https://twitter.com/kevmodrome/status/1463151477174714373) after the event that he will now be working full-time on Svelte Society!
