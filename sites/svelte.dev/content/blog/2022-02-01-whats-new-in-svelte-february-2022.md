Happy February, everyone! Over the last month or so, we've seen Svelte and SvelteKit [develop at rapid speed](accelerating-sveltes-development), new community rules across the [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/comments/s9n8ou/new_rules/), [GitHub](https://github.com/sveltejs/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/457912077277855764/831611707667382303/935264550436102315), and quite a few amazing apps, tutorials and libraries.

Let's take a look...

## Highlights from the Svelte changelog
- **3.45.0** brought a [new a11y warning `a11y-no-redundant-roles`](https://svelte.dev/docs#accessibility-warnings-a11y-no-redundant-roles), destructuring and caching fixes
- **3.46.0** added the much requested [`{@const}` tag](https://svelte.dev/docs#template-syntax-const) and [`style:` directive](https://svelte.dev/docs#template-syntax-element-directives-style-property)
- Check out **3.46.1 - 3.46.3** for fixes to the `{@const}` tag and `style:` directive, along with a number of fixes to animations
- [AST output is now available in the Svelte REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/hello-world)

## What's new in SvelteKit
- `inlineStyleThreshold` allows you to specify where inline stylesheets are inserted into the page ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#inlinestylethreshold), [#2620](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/2620))
- `beforeNavigate`/`afterNavigate` lifecycle functions lets you add functionality before or after a page navigation ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$app-navigation), [#3293](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/3293))
- Platform context can now be passed from adapters ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters#supported-environments-platform-specific-context), [#3429](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/3429))
- Hooks now have an `ssr` parameter in `resolve` to make it easier to skip SSR, when needed ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/hooks#handle), [#2804](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/2804))
- `$page.stuff` provides a mechanism for pages to pass data 'upward' to layouts ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/loading#input-stuff), [#3252](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/3252))
- Fallthrough routes let you specify where to route when an route can't be loaded ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#advanced-routing-fallthrough-routes), [#3217](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/3217))

**New configs**
- Content Security Policy (CSP) is now supported for increased security when using inline javascript or stylesheets ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#csp), [#3499](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/3499))
- `kit.routes` config allows you to customise public/private modules during build ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#routes), [#3576](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/3576))
- `prerender.createIndexFiles` config lets you prerender index.html files as their subfolder's name ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#prerender), [#2632](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/2632))
- HTTP methods can now be overridden using `kit.methodOverride` ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#endpoints-http-method-overrides), [#2989](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/2989))

**Config changes**
- `config.kit.hydrate` and `config.kit.router` are now nested under `config.kit.browser` ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#browser), [3578](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/3578))

**Breaking change**
- use `Request` and `Response` objects in endpoints and hooks ([#3384](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/3384))
