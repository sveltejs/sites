description: "Goodbye fallthrough routes, hello param validators!"

This month, we felt a shift in the way SvelteKit handles page properties. The last holdout of the use-cases that required fallthrough routes, validating parameter properties, has been replaced by a more specific solution.

More on that, and what else is new in Svelte, as we dive in...

## What's new in SvelteKit
- Param matchers allow you to check if a url parameter matches before rendering a page - replacing the need for fallthrough routes for this purpose ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#advanced-routing-matching), [#4334](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4334))
- Explicit redirects can now be handled directly from endpoints ([#4260](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4260))
- `svelte-kit sync` ([#4182](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4182)), TypeScript 4.6 ([#4190](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4190)) and Vite 2.9 were released - adding non-blocking dependency optimization and experimental CSS source maps in dev mode as well as a number of bug fixes contributed by the SvelteKit team ([#4468](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4468))


**New Config Options**
- `outDir` fixes path issues in monorepos and other situations where the desired output directory is outside the project directory ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#outdir), [#4176](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4176))
- `endpointExtensions` prevents files other than .js and .ts files from being treated as endpoints, unless you specify endpointExtensions ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#endpointextensions), [#4197](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4197))
- `prerender.default` lets you prerender every page without having to write `export const prerender = true` in every page file ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#prerender), [#4192](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4192))


**Breaking Changes**
- Fallthrough routes have been removed. For migration tips, check out the PR ([#4330](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4330))
- `tabindex="-1"` is only added to `<body>` during navigation ([#4140](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4140) and [#4184](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4184))
- Adapters are now required to supply a `getClientAddress` function ([#4289](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4289))
- `InputProps` and `OutputProps` can now be typed separately in generated `Load` ([#4305](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4305))
- The `\$` character is no longer allowed in dynamic parameters ([#4334](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4334))
- `svelte-kit package` has been marked as experimental so changes to it after Kit 1.0 will not be considered breaking ([#4164](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4164))


## New across the Svelte ecosystem
- Svelte: Lots of new types for TypeScript and Svelte plugin users - including `style:` directives and Svelte Actions (**3.46.4** and **3.46.5**)
- Language Tools: Svelte project files are now importable/findable through references without having them imported in a TS file ([105.13.0](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/releases/tag/extensions-105.13.0))
- Language Tools: Region folding is now supported in html with `<!--#region-->`/`<!--#endregion-->` ([105.13.0](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/releases/tag/extensions-105.13.0))
