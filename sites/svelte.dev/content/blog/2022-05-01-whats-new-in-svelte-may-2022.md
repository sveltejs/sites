With yesterday's Svelte Summit behind us, we've got a lot of news to share! Check out all of the recordings on the [Svelte Society YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/sveltesociety) and the rest of this month's updates below...

## What's new in Svelte
- The `<svelte:element>` element lets you render an element of a dynamically specified type. This is useful, for example, when rendering rich text content from a CMS. Check out the [docs](https://svelte.dev/docs#template-syntax-svelte-element) or the [tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte-element) for more info (**3.47.0**)!


## Language Tools updates
- `svelte:element` and `sveltekit:reload` are now supported
- Invalid Svelte import paths will now be automatically detected - see PR for getting back the old behavior ([#1448](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1448))
- `source.sortImports` lets you sort imports without deleting unused imports ([#1338](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/issues/1338))
- Hovering over HTML attributes will now show HTML hover info instead of the TS hover info - resulting in much more useful information ([#1447](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1447))
- In VS Code, you can now wrap existing blocks of code in control flow tags using the `Insert Snippet` command ([#1373](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1373))

## What's new in SvelteKit
- Files and directories can now be named `__tests__` and `__test__` in the routes directory ([#4438](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4438))
- Netlify Edge Functions ([#4657](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4657)) and the Vercel build output API ([#4663](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4663)) are now supported
- Custom `load` dependencies, array of strings representing URLs the page depends on, are now available when loading routes ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/loading#output-dependencies), [#4536](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4536))


**Breaking Changes**
- Validators are now called "matchers" ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#advanced-routing-matching), [#4358](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4358))
- `__layout.reset` has been replaced by named layouts - which have much configurability for shared layout elements ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/layouts#named-layouts), [#4388](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4388))
- Prerendering is now skipped for `rel="external"` links ([#4545](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4545))
- `maxage` is now `cache` in `LoadOutput` ([#4690](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4690))
