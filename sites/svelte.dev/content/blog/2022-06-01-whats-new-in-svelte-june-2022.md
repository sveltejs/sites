With last month's [Svelte Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqj2cBockqE) behind us, we're ready to apply everything we learned in this new month of June! Also new this month are some quality-of-life changes to `createEventDispatcher`, `@const` declarations and tons of progress toward SvelteKit 1.0.

Let's dive in!

## What's new in Svelte
- Custom events can now be cancelled in the `createEventDispatcher` function (**3.48.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs#run-time-svelte-createeventdispatcher), [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/7064))
- The `{@const}` tag can now be used in `{#if}` blocks to conditionally define variables (**3.48.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs#template-syntax-const), [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/7451))
- Lots of bug fixes across `<svelte:element>`, animations and various DOM elements. Check out the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3480) for a deeper dive!


## What's new in SvelteKit
- Vite 2.9.9 was released as one of the last Vite 2 releases. The Svelte team has been hard at work contributing to the Vite 3 release to make the integration between SvelteKit and Vite smoother than ever ([Vite 3.0 Milestone](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/milestone/5))
- `config.kit.alias` lets you more easily declare a custom alias to replace values in `import` statements ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#alias), [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4964))
- Pages marked for prerendering will now fail during SSR at runtime ([PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4812))

**Breaking Changes**
- Node 14 is no longer supported ([PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4922))
- Requests to `/favicon.ico` will no longer be suppressed and will instead be handled as a valid route ([PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5046))
- AMP support has been moved to a separate `@sveltejs/amp` package ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/seo#manual-setup-amp), [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4710))
- Generated types are now written to `_types` directories - update your imports accordingly ([PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4705))
- `%svelte.head%` and `%svelte.body%` are now `%sveltekit.head%` and `%sveltekit.body%` in `app.html` ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/migrating#project-files-src-template-html), [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5016/))
- `LoadInput` is now `LoadEvent`
- Dropped support for Wrangler 1 in favor of Wrangler 2 ([PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4887))
