There's a lot to cover this month... big changes are coming to SvelteKit's design before 1.0 can be completed. If you haven't already, check out Rich's Discussion, [Fixing `load`, and tightening up SvelteKit's design before 1.0 #5748](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/5748).

Also, [@dummdidumm](https://github.com/dummdidumm) (Simon H) [has joined Vercel to work on Svelte full-time](https://twitter.com/dummdidumm_/status/1549041206348222464) and [@tcc-sejohnson](https://github.com/tcc-sejohnson) has joined the group of SvelteKit maintainers! We're super excited to have additional maintainers now dedicated to working on Svelte and SvelteKit and have already been noticing their impact. July was the third largest month for SvelteKit changes since its inception!

Now onto the rest of the updates...

## What's new in SvelteKit
- Dynamically imported styles are now included during SSR ([#5138](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5138))
- Improvements to routes and prop updates to prevent unnecessary rerendering ([#5654](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5654), [#5671](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5671))
- Lots of improvements to error handling ([#4665](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4665), [#5622](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5622), [#5619](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5619), [#5616](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5616))
- Custom Vite modes are now respected in SSR builds ([#5602](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5602))
- Custom Vite config locations are now supported ([#5705](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5705))
- Private environment variables (aka "secrets") are now much more secure. Now if you accidentally import them to client-side code, you'll see an error ([#5663](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5663), [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#env))
- Vercel's v3 build output API is now being used in `adapter-vercel` ([#5514](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5514))
- `vite-plugin-svelte` has reached 1.0 and now supports Vite 3. You'll notice new default ports for `dev` (port 5173) and `preview` (port 4173) ([#5005](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5005), [vite-plugin-svelte CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte/blob/main/packages/vite-plugin-svelte/CHANGELOG.md))

**Breaking changes:**
- `mode`, `prod` and `server` are no longer available in `$app/env` ([#5602](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5602))
- `svelte-kit` CLI commands are now run using the `vite` command and `vite.config.js` is required. This will allow first-class support with other projects in the Vite ecosystem like Vitest and Storybook ([#5332](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5332), [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/project-structure#project-files-vite-config-js))
- `endpointExtensions` is now `moduleExtensions` and can be used to filter param matchers ([#5085](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5085), [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#moduleextensions))
- Node 16.9 is now the minimum version for SvelteKit ([#5395](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5395))
- %-encoded filenames are now allowed. If you had a `%` in your route, you must now encode it with `%25` ([#5056](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5056))
- Endpoint method names are now uppercased to match HTTP specifications ([#5513](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5513), [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#endpoints))
- `writeStatic` has been removed to align with Vite's config ([#5618](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5618))
- `transformPage` is now `transformPageChunk` ([#5657](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5657), [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/hooks#handle))
- The `prepare` script is no longer needed in `package.json` ([#5760](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5760))
- `adapter-node` no longer does any compression while we wait for a [bug fix in the `compression` library](https://github.com/expressjs/compression/pull/183) ([#5560](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5506))

- The `inert` [HTML attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#the-inert-attribute) is now supported in Svelte's language tools and plugins (**105.20.0**, [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1565))
