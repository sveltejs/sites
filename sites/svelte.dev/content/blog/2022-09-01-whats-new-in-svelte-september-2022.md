Still looking for something to do this month? It's your last chance to get tickets to Svelte Summit, Stockholm! [Join us on Sept 8-9th](https://www.sveltesummit.com/) ðŸŽ‰

With the redesign of SvelteKit's filesystem-based router merging early last month, there's lots to cover this month - from the [migration script](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/5774) to a number of new blog posts, videos and tutorials.

But the new routing isn't the only new feature in SvelteKit...

## What's new in SvelteKit
- `Link` is now supported as an HTTP header and works out of the box with Cloudflare's [Automatic Early Hints](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/5455) (**1.0.0-next.405**, [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5735))
- `$env/static/*` are now virtual to prevent writing sensitive values to disk (**1.0.0-next.413**, [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5825))
- `$app/stores` can now be used from anywhere on the browser (**1.0.0-next.428**, [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/6100))
- `config.kit.env.dir` is a new config that sets the directory to search for `.env` files (**1.0.0-next.430**, [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/6175))

**Breaking changes:**
- The filesystem-based router and `load` API improves the way routes are managed. **Before installing version `@sveltejs/kit@1.0.0-next.406` or later, [follow this migration guide](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/5774)** ([PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5778), [Issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/5748))
- `event.session` has been removed from `load` along with the `session` store and `getSession`. Use `event.locals` instead (**1.0.0-next.415**, [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5946))
- Named layouts have been removed in favor of `(groups)` (**1.0.0-next.432**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/advanced-routing#advanced-layouts), [PR & Migration Instructions](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/6174))
- `event.clientAddress` is now `event.getClientAddress()` (**1.0.0-next.438**, [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/6237))
- `$app/env` has been renamed to `$app/environment`, to disambiguate with `$env/...` (**1.0.0-next.445**, [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/6334))

For a full list of changes, check out kit's [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md).

**Updates to language tools**
- TypeScript doesn't resolve imports to SvelteKit's $types very well, the latest version of Svelte's language tools makes it better (**105.21.0**, [#1592](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1592))
