It's been a busy October for the Svelte community. `use:enhance` and Advanced Routes got some great improvements in SvelteKit while the Svelte compiler released a minor version to improve the day-to-day dev experience.

There's also a _huge_ showcase to cover... so let's jump in!

## What's new in SvelteKit
- The new `update` method for `use:enhance` lets you easily get back the default form behavior while augmenting it with your own logic ([docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/form-actions#progressive-enhancement-use-enhance), [#7083](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/7083) and [#7326](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/7326))
- `[[optional]]` parameters are now available for routing ([docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/advanced-routing#optional-parameters), [#7051](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/7051))
- `goto` now has `invalidateAll` to (re-)run all `load` functions belonging to the new active page ([docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$app-navigation-goto), [#7407](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/7407))
- `config.kit.paths.base` is now used in adapters looking for static assets - fixing 404 issues across `adapter-netlify`, `adapter-vercel`, `adapter-cloudflare`, and `adapter-cloudflare-workers` ([#4448](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4448))

**Breaking changes:**
- Errors will now be thrown when routes conflict ([#7051](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/7051))
- The global `fetch` override has been removed when prerendering ([#7318](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/7318))
- Route IDs have been prefixed with `/` ([#7338](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/7338))

## Svelte changes
- New accessibility warnings, `a11y-click-events-have-key-events` and `a11y-no-noninteractive-tabindex`, will now warn when your components lack required key events or tabindex. While `a11y-role-has-required-aria-props` will no longer warn when elements match their semantic role (**3.51.0**)
- `--style-props` are now supported on `<svelte:component>` and `<svg>` (**3.51.0**, Component Example: [Before](https://svelte.dev/repl/48984f20503f4959b70f24f4130d164b?version=3.47.0) and [After](https://svelte.dev/repl/48984f20503f4959b70f24f4130d164b?version=3.51.0), SVG Example: [Before](https://svelte.dev/repl/b7a3f94255914044b35462234ccaea43?version=3.50.0) and [After](https://svelte.dev/repl/b7a3f94255914044b35462234ccaea43?version=3.51.0))
- "nullish" values for component event handlers are now supported (**3.51.0**, [Example](https://svelte.dev/repl/9228022922af4c76af68ce42349ccbf9?version=3.51.0))
- Scoped styles can now be applied to `<svelte:element>` (**3.51.0**, [Example](https://svelte.dev/repl/23d982fc6f4f4f06a6aa227860fa2d84?version=3.51.0))
- You can now use `important` in inline style tags: `style:foo|important` (**3.52.0**, [#7365](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/7365))
- A warning will now be thrown when using `<a target="_blank">` without `rel="noreferrer"` (**3.52.0**, [#6188](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/6188))

Tom Smykowski also released a great summary of [all the changes in 3.52.0](https://tomaszs2.medium.com/svelte-3-52-0-improves-dev-experience-45f8c460bb96)!
