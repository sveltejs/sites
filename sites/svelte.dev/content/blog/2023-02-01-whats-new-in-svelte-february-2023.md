Since last month, we've seen a couple of minor versions across Svelte and SvelteKit, a bunch of educational content to support the 1.0 release, as well as the [State of JS survey](https://stateofjs.com) results...

Svelte, once again, increased in satisfaction and interest, so thanks to everyone who voted!

Let's dive into the updates...

## What's new in SvelteKit
Work in the Svelte ecosystem this month has been focused on SvelteKit bug fixes and addressing feedback from the 1.0 launch. One of the more awaited [bug fixes to SvelteKit's base path support](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/2958) landed, which means that you can now create SvelteKit projects on remote development environments. There have been several [new releases](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md) with these fixes as well as a handful of new features such as:
- The submitter's value will now be included automatically when progressively enhancing <form method="get"> (**1.0.3**, [#8273](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8273))
- Added an error in dev mode if global fetch is used with relative URL (**1.0.8**, [#8370](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8370))
- A warning will now indicated that hydration may break if comments are removed from HTML (**1.0.11**, [#8423](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8423))
- A warning will occur when of page options are used in `.svelte` files or a missing `<slot />` in layout is detected (**1.1.0**, [#8475](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8475))
- The new `text(...)` helper makes it easy to generate text responses (**1.2.0**, [#8371](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8371))
- The public env can now be accessed within app.html (**1.2.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/project-structure#project-files-src), [#8449](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8449))
- An error will now be thrown if cookie exceeds size limit (**1.2.1**, [#8591](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8591))
- The generated `tsconfig` can now be modified (**1.3.0**, [#8606](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8606))


## What's new in Svelte and Language Tools
- Added support for `html.customData` from the VS Code HTML language service (**extensions-107.0.0**, [#1824](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1824))
- Autocompletion for stores that need to be imported ([#1823](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1823)) and object/class member snippets ([#1817](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1817)) has been added to the Svelte extension (**extensions-107.0.0**)
- Improve detection of promises that are also functions (**Svelte 3.55.1**, [#8162](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/8162))
- Add missing types and properties for the global `part` attribute and `on:submit`, respectively (**Svelte 3.55.1**, [#8181](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/8181))
- Lots of performance and bug fixes (**Svelte 3.55.1*** and **extensions-107.0.x**)
