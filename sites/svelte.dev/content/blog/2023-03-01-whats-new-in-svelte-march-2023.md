March is *coming in hot* with a number of essential features having been added to SvelteKit following its 1.0 launch. Check out [last week's blog post](https://svelte.dev/blog/streaming-snapshots-sveltekit) for more details.

Svelte Society also launched [SvelteHack](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/) last month with over $12,000 in prizes - calling all Svelte developers, new and old, to make something awesome before the April 17th deadline!

And, if you haven't heard already, there's going to be another Svelte Summit! Head over to [SvelteSummit.com](https://www.sveltesummit.com/) and sign up for the newsletter to get updates about the next event ðŸ“¬

Now let's jump into this month's changes...

## What's new in SvelteKit
- `$app/paths` can now be used without an app - making things like component testing with Vitest, using Storybook, etc. easier (**1.4.0**, [#8838](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8838))
- Adapters can now be configured at the route level (**1.5.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options#config), [#8740](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8740))
- The new snapshot mechanism preserves ephemeral DOM state even after navigation and page reloads (**1.5.0**,[Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/snapshots), [#8710](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8710))
- `OPTIONS` are now available within the server method (**1.6.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#server), [#8731](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8731))
- Richer error messages have been added for invalid exports (**1.7.0**, [#9055](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9055))
- Streaming promises are now available for server load functions (**1.8.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#streaming-with-promises), [#8901](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8901))
- A new configuration option, `preloadStrategy`, helps tune preloading to avoid import 'waterfalls' on certain browsers (**1.8.4**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#output), [#9179](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9179))
- The new `paths.relative` option can control interpretation of `paths.assets` and `paths.base` (**1.9.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#paths), [#9220](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9220))


## What's new in Svelte and Language Tools
- The REPL on `svelte.dev` now supports the `exports` field in `package.json` ([#445](https://github.com/sveltejs/sites/pull/445))
- The new Call Hierarchy feature lets you see where a function or a class is called and follow the call stack up (**extensions-107.1.0**, [#1889](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1889))
- `declarationMap` support has been added to the Svelte extension. Now "go to definition" on `.svelte` files will navigate to the source code when a library has declaration maps (**extensions-107.1.0**, [#1878](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1878))
- [TypeScript Inlay Hints](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-editing#_inlay-hints) support is now available via the Svelte Extension. Enable them with `javascript.inlayHints.*` or `typescript.inlayHints.*` (**extensions-107.1.0**, [#1855](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1855))

*for all the changes to the Svelte compiler, including unreleased changes, check out the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
