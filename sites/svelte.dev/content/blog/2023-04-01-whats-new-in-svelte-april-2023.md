Happy April, everyone! This month, we're covering all the new features in the Svelte compiler, some quality-of-life improvements in SvelteKit and a huge showcase (like always).

In core team news, Dominic Gannaway has joined Vercel to work on Svelte full-time! Dominic is a world-class expert on wringing performance out of javascript engines, on the DOM, on reactivity, on accessibility, and more! You might know him as the creator of the [Inferno](https://www.infernojs.org/) UI framework or [Lexical](https://lexical.dev/), Meta's WYSIWYG editor. It'll be great to see his talents at work across the Svelte ecosystem 🌱

Don't forget! Svelte Summit Spring, Svelte's 6th virtual conference, will be happening on May 6th. Also, there's just two weeks left until the end of [SvelteHack](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/)... It's a great opportunity to share your creations with the community and maybe even earn a prize!

Now let's jump into this month's changes...
