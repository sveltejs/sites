Before we dive into the updates, there's a few announcements worth mentioning at the top:

## New Svelte Ambassadors
Regular features of this newsletter and all-around great content creators for Svelte [JoyOfCode](https://www.youtube.com/@JoyofCodeDev) and [HuntaByte](https://www.youtube.com/@Huntabyte) have been appointed as Svelte Ambassadors. Ambassadors are people who are well known for their helpfulness and contributions and for upholding Svelte‚Äôs reputation as a friendly, welcoming community, and we‚Äôre deeply grateful for their involvement!

## SvelteHack winners will be announced May 6th
In a just a few days, we'll find out who won [SvelteHack](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/) - the Svelte Hackathon that took place between February 17th and April 17th. Tune in to [Svelte Summit](https://www.sveltesummit.com/) on May 6th to see if your favorite project was chosen üëÄ

Lots of submissions to the hackathon are featured in this month's showcase... but first, let's see what's new!

## What's new in Svelte
- `style` blocks now support CSS `@container` queries (**3.58.0**)
- `bind:innerText` is now available for `contenteditable` elements (**3.58.0**)
- A new accessability warning, `a11y-interactive-supports-focus` will now warn when interactive elements are not focusable (**3.58.0**)

For all the changes to the Svelte compiler, including unreleased changes, check out the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's new in SvelteKit
- When hot module reloading (HMR) is enabled, the page will reload after an error is fixed (**1.14.0**, [#9497](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9497))
- Two apps loaded into the same html page can now be loaded simultaneously in "embedded" mode (**1.15.7**, [#9610](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9610))
- Vite's compilation will now log warnings for packages that use the `svelte` field to resolve Svelte files differently than standard Vite resolve (**vite-plugin-svelte@2.1.0**, **kit@1.15.8**)


## What's new in Language Tools
- Support for `<svelte:document>` ([#1958](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1958)) and intellisense report for new bindings ([#1957](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1957)) (**107.3.0**)
- The new fix-all menu option for the "Quick fix..." makes it easy to "Add all missing imports" and other detected errors (**107.3.0**, [#1939](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1939))
- We have a new and better official [ESLint plugin](https://github.com/sveltejs/eslint-plugin-svelte)! Previous support for Svelte in ESLint did not handle the template AST well, resulting in false positive/negatives and a high barrier to custom ESLint rules. This new official version is based on [ota-meshi](https://github.com/ota-meshi)'s [svelte-eslint-parser](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-eslint-parser) and is ready for prime time. Try it out and [share your feedback](https://github.com/sveltejs/eslint-plugin-svelte/issues)!
