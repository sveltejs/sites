Welcome to June everyone and [congrats to our SvelteHack winners](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/winners), across all the categories! If you missed it, these winners were announced at Svelte Summit on May 6th ðŸŽ‰

The entire playlist of the summit, including all the talks broken up in to separate videos, can be found [on the Svelte Society YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8bMgX1kyZTiODueVnrK5GR42u3hgN13X). So check it out, if you haven't already.

Lots to cover in this month's newsletter, including a lot of improvements to both Svelte and Kit...

## What's new in Svelte
[Svelte 4.0.0-next.0](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/releases), the first pre-release version of Svelte 4.0 is out! An explanation of the changes, improvements and goals of this release can be found in [the Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/releases/tag/svelte%404.0.0-next.0). Check it out to get an early sneak peek of the future of Svelte. It also includes a migration guide, for those interested in the minimal amount of breaking changes and deprecations.

Svelte 3.59.0 is also out, with a ton of new features:
- Restructuring arrays with the spread operator (`...`) is now handled correctly (**3.59.0**, [#8552](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/8552), [#8554](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/8554))
- The new `a11y-autocomplete-valid` warning will now warn if the autocomplete attribute isn't used according to the HTML specification (**3.59.0**, [Examples](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/d32a27fb64f4127d31e4e76bd08e319cfaf0ba53/docs/rules/autocomplete-valid.md), [#8520](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/8520))
- `fullscreenElement` and `visibilityState` bindings are now available for the `<svelte:document>` element (**3.59.0**, [#8507](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/8507))
- The `devicePixelRatio` binding is now available for the `<svelte:window>` element (**3.59.0**, [#8285](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/8285))
- The `ResizeObserver` bindings `contentRect`/`contentBoxSize`/`borderBoxSize`/`devicePixelContentBoxSize` are now usable with `bind:`(**3.59.0**, [#8022](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/8022))

For all the changes to the Svelte compiler, including unreleased changes, check out the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's new in SvelteKit
- Route-level entry generators allow exporting an entries function from `+page`, `+page.server`, and `+server` files to supply possible values for params for prerendering (**1.16.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options#entries), [#9571](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9571))
- URLs in `<meta>` tags are now crawled to make programmatic social-images much easier (**1.17.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/seo#manual-setup-title-and-meta), [#9900](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9900))
- `data` and `form` have been renamed to `formData` and `formElement` respectively in the `enhance` function. Using them through the old names will log a deprecation warning and they'll be removed in a future version. (**1.17.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/form-actions#progressive-enhancement-use-enhance), [#9902](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9902))
- Link options can now be set to `true` and `false` (**1.19.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/link-options#disabling-options), [#10039](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/10039))
- The new `resolvePath` export can be used to build relative paths from route IDs and parameters (**1.19.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#sveltejs-kit-resolvepath), [#9949](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9949))
