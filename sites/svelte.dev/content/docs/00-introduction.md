This page contains detailed API reference documentation. It's intended to be a resource for people who already have some familiarity with Svelte.

If that's not you (yet), you may prefer to visit the [interactive tutorial](tutorial) or the [examples](examples) before consulting this reference.

Don't be shy about asking for help in the [Discord chatroom](chat).

Using an older version of Svelte? Have a look at the [v2 docs](https://v2.svelte.dev).
