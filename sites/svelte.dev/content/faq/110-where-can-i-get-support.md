question: Where can I get support?
---

If your question is about certain syntax, the [API page](https://svelte.dev/docs) is a good place to start.

Stack Overflow is a popular forum to ask code-level questions or if youâ€™re stuck with a specific error. Read through the existing questions tagged with [Svelte](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/svelte+or+svelte-3) or [ask your own](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=svelte)!

There are online forums and chats which are a great place for discussion about best practices, application architecture or just to get to know fellow Svelte users. [Our Discord](https://svelte.dev/chat) or [the Reddit channel](https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/) are examples of that. If you have an answerable code-level question, Stack Overflow is usually a better fit.
