question: How do I do hot module reloading?
---

We recommend using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), which supports HMR out of the box and is built on top of Vite and svelte-hmr. There are also community plugins for [rollup](https://github.com/rixo/rollup-plugin-svelte-hot) and [webpack](https://github.com/rixo/svelte-loader-hot).
